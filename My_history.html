          My story is a bit messy, but itâ€™s mine. I was born in 2004 and have
          lived in India for most of my life. Iâ€™ve had the same friends since
          school and made a few more in college. While we donâ€™t meet in person
          much anymore, we talk on Discord almost every day.

          My family is pretty normal â€” in fact, we live in a joint family setup.
          I lost my mother when I was four years old, and since then Iâ€™ve been
          raised by my father, his brother, and their families. I also have an
          elder sister, and together we've built a strong bond through all the
          ups and downs.

          Outside of studies and tech, Iâ€™ve always been curious about how people
          think and why the world works the way it does. That curiosity is what
          led me into cybersecurity. Itâ€™s not just about coding â€” itâ€™s about
          solving puzzles, protecting people, and understanding systems deeply.
          I love that it blends logic with creativity.

          I grew up in Gujarat, India. Most of my childhood was spent surrounded
          by family, playing cricket in the streets, and tinkering with tech.
          Even though I moved around a bit, Gujarat has always felt like home.

          Iâ€™m currently studying in the U.S., and adjusting to life here has
          been both exciting and challenging. But I see every obstacle as an
          opportunity to grow. Whether itâ€™s a coding bug or a tough day far from
          home, I remind myself why I started this journey â€” to build something
          meaningful and make my family proud.

          Iâ€™ve had a close group of friends since school. We might be miles
          apart now, but weâ€™re still connected â€” through memes, game nights, and
          late-night rants on Discord. Theyâ€™ve stuck with me through a lot, and
          Iâ€™m grateful for that.

          Iâ€™m a proud Hindu, and my faith is a big part of who I am. I believe
          in karma, in staying grounded, and in treating others with respect.
          Even when life feels uncertain, my beliefs give me peace and clarity.

          Coming from Gujarat, being business-minded kind of runs in our veins.
          Gujaratis are known for being resourceful, entrepreneurial, and
          hardworking. Whether itâ€™s running a shop, building a startup, or
          managing a side hustle â€” that spirit of independence and hustle is
          something I truly admire.

          My story isnâ€™t perfect â€” itâ€™s honest, real, and uniquely mine. Every
          challenge, every step, has helped shape who I am today.
